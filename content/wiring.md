# Electrical Wiring
## Overview

The ShapeOko 2 electrical wiring is, like the rest of the machine, versatile. There are 3 known ways to wire the machine easily. Each option has been broken into a different page, for clarity. Depending on your setup, and skill set, one setup may be better for you than another. Chose your setup by evaluating the requirements of the process.

## Routing

In all scenarios, your stepper wires will be initially be routed as such:

## Option #1
This is the direct wire method that requires (modest) soldering skills to complete. You can assemble the entire machine before doing this step.

###You will need the following tools and parts to complete this option

* Soldering Iron
* Solder
* Wire Strippers
* Heat Shrink Tubing (2 sizes) (or electrical tape)
* Zip Ties (about a dozen)
* 4 Position Terminal Block (optional)
* Expandable braiding (2 sizes), optional

## Option #2
This is the terminal block method. This method is pretty easy, but requires that you make some preparations **WHILE** you are assembling the machine.

###You will need the following tools and parts to complete this option

* Screw Driver
* 4 Position Terminal Block x 3
* Razor Blade (wire stripper)
* M3 x 16mm SHCS x 6
* M3 flat washer x 12
* M3 hex nut x 6
* Zip Ties
* Expandable Braiding

## Option #3 
This is the 'mount the controller on the machine' method. It's experimental, it's untested, it's **hot**. You can assemble the entire machine before doing this step. If you venture down this path, you're an explorer, and may be on your own. It might be worth it.
