###You will need the following tools and parts to complete this option

####Parts

* 4 Position Terminal Block x 3
* Zip Ties
* Expandable Braiding

You may either Zip tie the terminal blocks to the motor carriages or bolt them, if you bolt them you will also need:

* M3 x 16mm SHCS x 6 pcs.
* M3 flat washer x 12 pcs.
* M3 hex nut x 6 pcs. 

####Tools

* Razor Blade (wire stripper)
* Screw Driver, 2mm straight (for connecting the grey stepper wires to the Arduino)
* Screw Driver, #2 Philips or 9/32" flat (for the combination screws on the terminal blocks)
* 5.5 mm open end wrench
* 2.5 mm Hex key
