#Pro Tips!

###Electronics and Mechanicals

Take a look at the [wiring page](wiring.html) before beginning assembly. Depending on the method you decide to employ, you may have to do some wiring as you assemble.

The assembly instructions have these two steps separated. The first step is for **testing** your electronics. As noted in the details of that step, it's easier to troubleshoot, and if there's a major problem, you won't have to disassemble the machine. It is best to partially disassemble the electronics after testing them in order to mount the motors onto the appropriate motor mount carriage plates.

###Tools

Only basic tools are required to assemble the Shapeoko 2. The following tools are included with the full kits [sold through inventables.com](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/desktop-cnc-mill-kit-shapeoko-2). If you are rolling your own full kit (you bought the mechanical kit), use the following list as a guideline for [what you will need to assemble the machine](http://www.shapeoko.com/wiki/index.php/Tools).

![image of tools spread out](tPictures/tool_kit.jpg)

* Hex Key Set 1.5 / 2.0 / 2.5 / 3.0 / 4.0 mm
* Screw Driver 2.0mm blade
* Wrench 13mm (1/2") Qty 2
* Wrench 8mm (5/16")
* M5x0.8mm Tap and handle
* Safety glasses
* cable ties (100)
* thread lock
* razor blade (for stripping / cutting wires)

There is one additional item:

* Spiral End Mill

which is intended for use with the machine in the rotary tool once it is fully operational.

###Screw Sizes (lengths)


For the most part, it's obvious which size screw is used for what, but the M5 8mm and 12mm BHCS (button head cap screws) are easily confused with the 10mm length --- while it's not noticeable when the shorter 10mm length is used where one ought to use a 12mm, the 10mm screws are intended for use with MakerSlide insertion nuts and a 12mm screw is too long and will bottom out before beginning to hold anything in place.

###A Note on Tapping

Tapping means to cut threads on the inside of a hole.  There is an entire industry based around this process, and some people take it very seriously. If you look around the internet you can find 1,000s of site with "drill and tap" charts. These charts tell a person how big of a hole is required to be tapped to a certain thread size. There is an article on Wikipedia describing [Tap and Die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_and_die).

When tapping, it's important to not just torque down and twist as hard as you can.

The holes only need to be tapped ~12mm deep for the M5x12mm screws, but may be tapped deeper if using longer bolts. 

#####Taps Are Brittle - Don't drop them on a cement floor.

The tap has to be harder than the material it's tapping. Because of that hardening, it's brittle, as in easily broken. You want to avoid breaking the tap like you would avoid getting the plague. Use a proper T-handle (such as the one included with your kit) to turn the tap. Don't use a wrench, locking pliers, or a vice. Yeah, those last three will work, but you'll be playing with fire.


#####Lubricate - a little bit will go a long way.

Lubricating will reduce the amount of friction produced while tapping, making the tap handle easier to turn. It could also aid in chip removal as there will be less friction keeping the chips in. You can use tapping fluid, motor oil, WD-40, butter, PAM, water, etc., or basically anything that's wet. You won't need a lot of whatever you chose. Whatever you choose, be careful to clean it up afterwards, especially if it's water-based which might create the possibility of corrosion, or oily which will stain the wasteboard.


#####Take Your Time - this is not a race.

No, seriously this is not a race. You don't want to break one of these things. Not only will you be really mad at yourself, but you'll also have to buy a new piece of MakerSlide (or use kitchen chemistry to dissolve the broken tap, see the wiki), a new tap, and possibly anything else that you break during your outburst. So, take your time and go slow.


#####You're a Breaker now - a chip breaker that is.

Take a look at your tap. It's not like a screw where the threads go all the way around the body. There are 4 sections of teeth, separated by vertical gaps called _flutes_. The teeth cut the metal, and the flutes act as an evacuation channel. Yeah, that's right, an evacuation channel. That's bad ass....


Anyway, the flutes keep the chips out of the way so the teeth can keep cutting. Once you feel some resistance, you need to reverse the tap until you feel those chips clear. In some cases (towards the end of the tap) you'll need to reverse it all the way out, clean the tap (just brush off the chips), and then go at it again. The smaller the tap, the easier it is to break. Your tap is an M5 x 0.8mm tap. That's not the smallest tap in the world, but it's not very big either. So, be careful!


The awesome news is that you can hone your tapping skillz (with a z!) by practicing on the Z-axis MakerSlide (the short one that measures 200mm). We only need 1 end of that piece tapped, so if you were to make a mistake while learning, no big deal. Just flip the piece over and use the other side. But, you only get 2 practice holes! Use them wisely.

###MakerSlide

[MakerSlide](http://www.shapeoko.com/wiki/index.php/Makerslide) is a system consisting of:

- 20x40mm aluminum extrusion profile with a built in V-rail
- Delrin "V" wheels that ride on the V-rail
- Plates and hardware to put it together

Extrusion profiles and other CAD data are available at [makerslide.com](http://www.makerslide.com/).
