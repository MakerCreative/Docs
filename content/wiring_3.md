## Option #3 
This is the 'mount the controller on the machine' method. It's experimental, it's untested, it's **hot**. You can assemble the entire machine before doing this step. If you venture down this path, you're an explorer, and may be on your own. It might be worth it.


_note: in all the pictures shown below, yellow zip ties are used. these are preferred for documentation because they are more visible than the black zip ties included with your kit_

###You will need the following to complete this option

* Zip Ties
* Expandable Braiding (2 sizes)
* Razor Blade (wire strippers)
* Bravery & Courage

###X and Z wiring 
Looking at the machine from the back, the idea is to pull down the wires from the Z-axis stepper motor to the x-axis carraige. Then pull up the x-axis stepper motor wires to the top of the carriage, so you can zip tie them together using the included zip ties.

####Expandable Braiding
The included expandable braiding can be used in this step as well. The best way to thread the wires through the braiding is to twist them together, forming two 'groups', like so:

![expandable braiding step 1](wiring/38-so_wiring-037.jpg)

And then you can start threading both groups (simultaneously) through the expandable braiding. This isn't hard, but takes a little time if you've never done it before.

####Routing Wires
After the wires are pulled through the braiding, continue pulling until both wires are tight. They will be uneven lengths (because the z-axis is further away!).

Be sure you have approximately 5 inches of wire for the x-axis. We are going to route that **around* the stepper motor, so we'll need a longer length to make it to the controller.

Once you do, put a zip tie on the end of the braiding to keep it from fraying and to keep it from sliding back down.

Then, zip tie that, to the side motor mount

Now that the bundle has been zied to the motor mount plate, go ahead and route the wires around the stepper motor as shown below. Once that is finished, you are done (for now) with the X and Z stepper motor wires. Just move those out of the way. Now it's time to wire up the Y axis!

###Y Axis
Here is an overview of how the Y-axis wires are routed. From the front, you can see the second Y stepper motor (the one on the left side of the machine), has it's wires routed through the makerslide.

It's easiest if you slide the gantry all the way towards the left side. Then twist the wires together (like we did to get them through the expandable braiding earlier), then thread the wires through the horizontal slot on the carriage plates. Like this:

![start threading](wiring/27-so_wiring-026.jpg)

Once you have pushed the wires past the gantry, grab the bundle and pull it out from between the pieces of makerslide. It's easier to do this than try to thread it all the way across.

![keep threading](wiring/28-so_wiring-027.jpg)

At the opposite side of what you started, thread the wires through the carriage plate's top slot. Like this

![keep threading](wiring/29-so_wiring-028.jpg)

Now pull the wires so they are fairly taught on the otherside. Be careful not to pull too hard!

If it's done right, you'll end up with something like this.
