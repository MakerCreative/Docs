#Assembly Overview

##Welcome!

Thank you for supporting Project Shapeoko. The following pages are filled with all the information you need to assemble your Shapeoko 2 desktop CNC machine.  If you have any difficulties with assembly, please check the ShapeOko [wiki](http://www.shapeoko.com/wiki) and [forums](http://www.shapeoko.com/forum/index.php).


###Tools

Only basic tools are required to assemble the Shapeoko 2. The following tools are included with the full kits [sold through inventables.com](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/desktop-cnc-mill-kit-shapeoko-2). If you are rolling your own full kit (you bought the mechanical kit), use the following list as a guideline for what you will need to assemble the machine.

##Assembly Steps

##Software
[Goto the Instructions](software.html)

Before we can control our machine, we need to install and/or configure some software. If you're going to test your electronics, then you'll need to have this step done before you can complete that step. Otherwise, you'll need to complete this step before running Hello, World.

##Electronics
[Goto the Instructions](electronics.html)

In this step, we will *test* our electronics setup. It's beneficial to do this prior to assembling the machine, as some issues are more easily addressed before assembly takes place. If a problem were to occur, it's much easier to troubleshoot without having to disassemble the machine!

##V-Wheels and Idlers
[Goto the Instructions](wheels.html)

A lot of the "work" required to assemble the machine is done in this step. It's not hard work, but it'll take a while. Just like long division.

##Carriages
[Goto the Instructions](carriages.html)

This is the most labor intensive part of the assembly. You will be assembling 3 motor mount plates.

##Z-Axis
[Goto the Instructions](zaxis.html)

The z-axis is comprised of 3 seperate assemblies, and will require some time (and patience) to fully assemble. once you are done with this step, your machine will really start to take shape.
